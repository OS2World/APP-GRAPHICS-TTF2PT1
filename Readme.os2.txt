README.OS2 from Version 3.3.3:

This archive contains the original source, binaries and the file
os2build.cmd for rebulding the binaries.

The OS/2 binaries are ttf2pt1.exe and t1asm.exe

For usage instructions see the README.html file.

The binaries have been compiled with GCC, and they require the
emx 0.9d runtime. If you don't have it, get emxrt.zip from Hobbes.

If you have problems with the OS/2 version, please contact me.

README.OS2 additions for Version 3.4.4:

I took a look at the 3.3.3 package, modified the os2build.cmd
for version 3.4.4 and compiled it using old GCC/EMX.

It needs emxrt 0.9d runtime, like the older package.
